# Samkalpahs

This is a sample *Samkalpa Path* (sacred resolution).  
It includes automated updates of the lunar phase (Paksha), date (Tithi), weekday (Vaar), constellation (Nakshatra), half-day division (Karana), yoga, and moon's position.  
The start and end times of the respective date, etc., are also provided below.

All the scripts related to this calendar (Panchang) are sourced from [panchang.js](https://github.com/schenna/panchangJS) on GitHub.  
The full credit for this work goes to its creator, *shrinivash schenna*. I have only developed the user interface for it.
